## Introduction 📖
This project aims to realise a 2D Game to put our OOP principles into practice.
We can move our game in any direction we want. <br>

We wanted to make a RPG game, and we got inspired by several games:
- Tales of Symphonia 2003 (for menus, music and sound effects)
- Secret of Mana 1993 (for map movement)
- Final Fantasy (for turn-based combat)

To make the game possible, we needed to realise the following steps :
- Create a gameloop (with a fixed timestep -> 60fps)
- Create a map with a camera and tiles
- Create a player and npc with animations
- Create a combat system
- Create a menu system

The game has been created with Javaswing and must respect the MVC architecture as much as possible.
